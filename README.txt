This app was created as the final project for my Mobile App Development course. 
I worked in a team with 2 others to create this app, which uses a free API to provide the user with food and cocktail recipes.
We C# and XML in Xamarin and Visual Studio to write the code for our app. We also used a bit of JSON near the end for our API.
